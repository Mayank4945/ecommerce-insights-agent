- Automatic visualization selection
- Business context and recommendations

**Beyond One-Shot Queries**:
- True conversation with memory
- Context-aware follow-up questions
- Session persistence

**Beyond Database-Only**:
- External knowledge integration
- Industry insights and definitions
- Multi-language support

**Production Quality**:
- Comprehensive error handling
- Security measures
- Logging and monitoring
- Configuration management
- Extensive documentation
